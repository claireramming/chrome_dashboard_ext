# Personal Dashboard

Created with customization after scrimba course on working with APIs

To use you will need your own [API-Football API](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-football/) key.

### Customizations past Scrimba course:
- Current week's NWSL games, scores will appear once the games are finished
- NWSL standings table (API not currently up to date so it is showing all 0s currently)
- localStorage integration to keep API calls to one a day for API-Football

### Potential future updates
- add latest 3 or so headlines related to league using news API
- allow user customization so background picture can be self-selected or keyword to pick background picture can be team specific
